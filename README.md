# CloudSimMig: An Extensive Framework For Modeling And Simulation Of Migration Planning and Scheduling in Clouds #

Based on CloudSimSDN, we add live migration events and corresponding mechanisms regarding pre-migration, reservation, iterative dirty memory-copying, stop-and-copy, activation, and post-migration phases.

It can properly simulate the resource dependencies among migrations, and between migration traffic and service traffic during migrations.

As a result, It can evaluate the performance of multiple migration schedule in total migration time, individual migration time, downtime, transferred data, application response time,
migration deadline violation, and energy consumption due to migrations.
